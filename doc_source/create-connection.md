# Creating a connection<a name="create-connection"></a>

You can create a standalone connection, or you can create a connection to associate with a LAG in your account\. If you associate a connection with a LAG, it's created with the same port speed and location that is specified in the LAG\.

If you do not have equipment at an AWS Direct Connect location, first contact an AWS Direct Connect Partner at the AWS Direct Connect Partner Program\. For more information, see [APN Partners Supporting AWS Direct Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/partners)\.

**To create a new AWS Direct Connect connection**

1. Open the AWS Direct Connect console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/directconnect/v2/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/v2/home)\.

1. On the **AWS Direct Connect** screen, under **Get started**, choose **Create a connection**\.

1. On the **Create Connection** pane, under **Connection settings,** do the following:

   1. For **Name**, enter a name for the connection\.

   1. For **Location**, select the appropriate AWS Direct Connect location\.

   1. If applicable, for **Sub Location**, choose the floor closest to you or your network provider\. This option is only available if the location has meet\-me rooms \(MMRs\) in multiple floors of the building\.

   1. For **Port Speed**, choose the connection bandwidth\.

1. For **On\-premises**, select **Connect through an AWS Direct Connect partner** when you use this connection to connect to your data center\.

1. 

   1. \(Optional\) Add or remove a tag\.

      \[Add a tag\] Choose **Add tag** and do the following:
      + For **Key**, enter the key name\.
      + For **Value**, enter the key value\.

      \[Remove a tag\] Next to the tag, choose **Remove tag**\.

## Downloading the LOA\-CFA<a name="create-connection-loa-cfa"></a>

After AWS has processed your connection request, you can download the LOA\-CFA\. 

If you need to change the LOA\-CFA after it has been created \(for example, you need to change the ports\), contact AWS Support\.

**To download the LOA\-CFA**

1. Open the AWS Direct Connect console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/directconnect/v2/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/v2/home)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Connections**\.

1. Select the connection and choose **View details**\.

1. Choose **Download LOA\-CFA**\. 
**Note**  
If the link is not enabled, the LOA\-CFA is not yet available for you to download\. Check your email for a request for information\. If it's still unavailable, or you haven't received an email after 72 hours, contact [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/support/createCase)\.

1. Send the LOA\-CFA to your network provider or colocation provider so that they can order a cross connect for you\. The contact process can vary for each colocation provider\. For more information, see [Requesting cross connects at AWS Direct Connect locations](Colocation.md)\.

The LOA\-CFA expires after 90 days\. If your connection is not up after 90 days, we send you an email alerting you that the LOA\-CFA has expired\. To refresh the LOA\-CFA with a new issue date, download it again from the AWS Direct Connect console\. If you do not take any action, we delete the connection\.

**Note**  
Port\-hour billing starts 90 days after you created the connection, or after the connection between your router and the AWS Direct Connect endpoint is established, whichever comes first\. For more information, see [AWS Direct Connect Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/pricing/)\. If you no longer want the connection after you have reissued the LOA\-CFA, you must delete the connection yourself\. For more information, see [Deleting connections](deleteconnection.md)\.
