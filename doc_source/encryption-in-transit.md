# Encryption in AWS Direct Connect<a name="encryption-in-transit"></a>

AWS Direct Connect does not encrypt your traffic that is in transit\. To encrypt the data in transit that traverses AWS Direct Connect, you must use the transit encryption options for that service\. To learn about EC2 instance traffic encryption, see [Encryption in Transit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/data-protection.html#encryption-transit) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances\.

With AWS Direct Connect and AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN, you can combine one or more AWS Direct Connect dedicated network connections with the Amazon VPC VPN\. This combination provides an IPsec\-encrypted private connection that also reduces network costs, increases bandwidth throughput, and provides a more consistent network experience than internet\-based VPN connections\. For more information, see [Amazon VPC\-to\-Amazon VPC Connectivity Options](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/networking/aws-single-data-center-ha-network-connectivity/)\.
