# Encryption in AWS Direct Connect<a name="encryption-in-transit"></a>

AWS Direct Connect does not encrypt your traffic that is in transit\. To encrypt the data in transit that traverses AWS Direct Connect, you must use the transit encryption options for that service\. For example to learn about EC2 instance traffic encryption, see [Encryption in Transit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/data-protection.html#encryption-transit) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances\.
