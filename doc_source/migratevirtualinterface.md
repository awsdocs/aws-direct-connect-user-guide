# Migrate a virtual interface<a name="migratevirtualinterface"></a>

Use this procedure when you want to perform any of the following virtual interface migration operations:
+  Migrate an existing virtual interface associated with a connection to another LAG\.
+  Migrate an existing virtual interface associated with an existing LAG to a new LAG\.
+ Migrate an existing virtual interface associated with a connection to another connection\.

**Note**  
When you migrate or associate an existing virtual interface to a new connection, the configuration parameters that are associated with the virtual interfaces are the same\. You can pre\-stage the configuration on the connection, and then update the BGP configuration\.

**Important**  
The virtual Interface will go down for a brief period\. We recommend you perform this procedure during a maintenance window\.
