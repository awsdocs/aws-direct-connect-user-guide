AWS Direct Connect supports these port speeds over single\-mode fiber: 1 Gbps: 1000BASE\-LX \(1310nm\) and 10 Gbps: 10GBASE\-LR \(1310nm\)\.

1: You cannot create a transit virtual interface on a hosted connection with a capacity less than 1Gbps\.

If you want to use load balancing with multiple public VIFs, all the VIFs must be in the same Region\.
