AWS Direct Connect enables you to establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations\.

There are two types of connections:
+ Dedicated Connection: A physical Ethernet connection associated with a single customer\. Customers can request a dedicated connection through the AWS Direct Connect console, the CLI, or the API\. For more information, see [Dedicated connections](dedicated_connection.md)\.
+ Hosted Connection: A physical Ethernet connection that an AWS Direct Connect Partner provisions on behalf of a customer\. Customers request a hosted connection by contacting a partner in the AWS Direct Connect Partner Program, who provisions the connection\. For more information, see [Hosted connections](hosted_connection.md)\.
