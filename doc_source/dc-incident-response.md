# Logging and Monitoring in AWS Direct Connect<a name="dc-incident-response"></a>

You can use the following automated monitoring tools to watch AWS Direct Connect and report when something is wrong:
+ **Amazon CloudWatch Alarms** – Watch a single metric over a time period that you specify\. Perform one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods\. The action is a notification sent to an Amazon SNS topic\. CloudWatch alarms do not invoke actions simply because they are in a particular state; the state must have changed and been maintained for a specified number of periods\. For more information, see [Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch](monitoring-cloudwatch.md)\.
+ **AWS CloudTrail Log Monitoring** – Share log files between accounts and monitor CloudTrail log files in real time by sending them to CloudWatch Logs\. You can also write log processing applications in Java and validate that your log files have not changed after delivery by CloudTrail\. For more information, see [Logging AWS Direct Connect API Calls Using AWS CloudTrail](logging_dc_api_calls.md) and [Working with CloudTrail Log Files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-working-with-log-files.html) in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide*\.
